## Design Choices and Limitations

### Header.js
Here, I just have a simple header text.

### Table.js
The bulk of the project is completed in this file. Specific functionalities can be found in the comments.

In order to store each row's index, string input, and indices of substrings, I decided implement an array of objects that stores each value. 

'''
{something}
'''
